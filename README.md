# MotionMetricsVision

MotionMetricsVision is an advanced object tracking and motion analysis system developed using OpenCV and Matplotlib. It is designed to track multiple objects in real time, calculate their motion parameters, and visualize the results dynamically. This system can be utilized in various fields such as surveillance, sports analytics, and automated monitoring systems.

## Features

- **Multi-Object Tracking:** Simultaneously tracks multiple objects with unique identifiers.
- **Motion Analysis:** Calculates motion parameters including speed, acceleration, and trajectory.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Provides dynamic visualization of tracked objects and their motion paths.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allows customization of tracking and analysis settings.
- **Extensive Logging:** Maintains detailed logs of tracking data for further analysis.

# Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# Core libraries for computer vision and numerical computations
opencv-python==4.5.5.64
numpy==1.21.2
matplotlib==3.4.3

# For unit testing and mocking
unittest2==1.1.0

# Typing extensions (if needed for type hints)
typing-extensions==3.10.0.2
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brosiah96/MotionMetricsVision.git
cd MotionMetricsVision
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Run the main script to start the object tracking system:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration

The configuration file `config.yaml` allows you to customize the parameters for object tracking and motion analysis. Edit this file to adjust settings such as detection thresholds, tracking algorithms, and visualization preferences.

### Visualization

The application provides real-time visualization of tracked objects and their motion paths. The results are displayed in a window.
